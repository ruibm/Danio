# Danio: Args Parser for .NET


## Overview

Danio is a .NET library to manage command line arguments across c# files, libraries and binaries. This is done in a very clean way by defining your command line arguments are static fields in the classes where they are actually used. You just need to add the Attribute [Arg("My help message for this argument.")] to the field in question.


## Origin of the Name

Danio is the genus of a variety of fish such as the Zebra Fish.
